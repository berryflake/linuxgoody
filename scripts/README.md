# Yuo're in scripts deparment
## All the scripts should be clearly labeled.

- Every script should have an unambiguous description.
- I'll try to explain as detail as I can. Both for you and future me.
- I'm runing PopOS 20.4 /w NVIDIA Driver. Thus, some scripts might cause problems for you. Use with caution.
- Run any scripts that's on the internet is potentially hazardous. Check the code before executing, create backup actively.
