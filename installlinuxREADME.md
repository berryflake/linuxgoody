# Yuo're in linux installation folder
## Here you can find how to install all kind of linux distro.

- I can't try every distro myself, and as current, most of the Linux installation comes with GUI, thus make the installation a breeze.
- I'll try to explain as detail as I can. Both for you and future me.
- As current, I yet to have multiple machines to do the testing, therefore, caution while you following, found issues? report it.
- Run any scripts that's on the internet is **potentially hazardous**. Check the code before executing, **create backup actively.**
